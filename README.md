## Running
### The yarn way
```
yarn install 
```
and
```
yarn dev 
```
And that's it !

### The npm way

This app was built with yarn, though NPM should be able to run it just fine.
```
npm install
```
and
```
npm run dev
```
But you should really give [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) a closer look. ;)
